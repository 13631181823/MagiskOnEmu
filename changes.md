- **Bind mount data mirror again** in case filesystem mount under `/data` is binding mount of subdirectory from **ext4 partition**, this issue is happened when users install Android x86 into **ext4 partition** instead of **NTFS partition** (with `data.img`), causes Magisk think `/data` come from a device block (ext4 partition) and mount that device block into `(/sbin)/.magisk/mirror/data` which is not mirror for filesystem mount under `/data`
- Do not try to hide Selinux Permissive
- Hide `init.svc_debug_pid.*` magisk service traces on Android 11
